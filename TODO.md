MVP

- join and leave communities
- Create posts
- authorization and the permission model https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/#authorization-methods
- Create communities (admin only)
- Replies to posts
- Upvotes and downvotes
- Hot posts, new posts, top posts
- password reset
- Community search
- Community statistics (number of members, total number of posts, number of posts in last 24h / 7d / 30d)
- basic hardening of graphql endpoint against malicious actors
- production frontend

LATER

- Create more beautiful tooling. Datasetgenerator and datasetloader are useful but very raw right now.
- Clear up "any"s

DONE

- unit tests for api
- database connection
- authentication and the user model
